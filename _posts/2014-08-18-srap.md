#Maintaining fast http responses and controlling your backend workload using asynchronous request processing

##When (not) to use this

This pattern is useful if you have to be prepared to handle a large amount of non trivial create or update requests to your backend in a short amount of time. Consider it especially if you have a public facing api or a spiky usage pattern.   

You will not be able to apply this technique if the clients requires a response containing processing results. At least not with a http endpoint. In this case consider to redesign your endpoint api to allow for "fire and forget" style requests. 

Does your client really need to know if the backend transaction completed successfully, or is it enough to acknowledge the delivery? 

Is it possible to pull the backend for results later?     

As always, this adds another level of complexity to your application. So only use it, if you need it. Fortunately, if you design your service api with this pattern in mind, its easy to add the implementation later.
