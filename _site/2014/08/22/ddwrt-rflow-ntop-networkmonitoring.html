<h2 id="my-setup">My setup</h2>
<p>I use an ancient wrt54 running dd-wrt to keep our home devices connected. it has no fancy gbit interfaces or super fast wlan, but aside from the occasional dhcpd crash, it is really a reliable little box. 
i think i have used it for over 9 years now.<br />
first with external antennas to connect to the residential community wlan, later when i switched to a dsl land line, i started to use it as my home router and wifi accesspoint..</p>

<p><img src="/assets/wrt54.jpg" alt="Linksys WRT-54G" /></p>

<p>The firmware i am using is <a href="www.dd-wrt.com">dd-wrt</a>.<br />
connected to its lan interfaces is a dsl router, my media center, PCs and network storage.<br />
the wlan interface is used as an AP for mobile devices.</p>

<h2 id="the-plan">The Plan!</h2>
<p>Whats missing is a tool that lets me “see” what is going on inside my home lan and wlan. who is talking to whom, which machine uses how much bandwidth, etc. <br />
since the wrt54 is the only device which is connected to lan and wlan, this is where the capturing tool will run. 
for data collection and crunching i plan to use ntop on another box.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-do-it">How to do it</h2>

<h3 id="setting-up-the-rflow-probe">Setting up the RFlow probe</h3>
<p>The probing can be activated in dd-wrt’s web console. The RFlow section is located under services and looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/dd-wrt-admin-rflow-section.png" alt="RFlow configuration via dd-wrt web console" /></p>

<p><em>Server ip</em> refers to the ntop host. <br />
<em>Port</em> can be any available port on the ntop box.AFAIR there are a few standard ports, and 9996 is apparently one of them.</p>

<p>Save the settings, and the router setup should be complete. easy!</p>

<h3 id="ntop">ntop</h3>

<h4 id="installation">Installation</h4>

<p><code>
lm@voyager3:~$ sudo apt-get install ntop*
</code></p>

<p>The installation routine asks for a <em>network interface</em> to listen on. “none” since the network traffic will be probed somewhere else. next you have to choose a <em>password</em> for ntops webinterface.</p>

<p>The designated ntop host is a box running ubuntu 14.04. i use apt-get to install all packages ntop. and again no errors, faults or exception. not even a lowly warning.
almost to easy to blog :D but its not done until its in production as they say.<br />
next is setting up ntop.</p>

<h4 id="setup">Setup</h4>

<p>ntop configuration is done in a webui. note that we are doing linux sysadmin stuff, and yet no config file has been touched and no kernel module has been compiled!<br />
personally, i dont like all this userfriendliness. kids these days.</p>

<p>the url is <code>http://&lt;ntop-host&gt;:3000</code>.  </p>

<p>to listen for data from the router on port 9996, ntop requires the configuration of a NetFlow Device. </p>

<p><img src="/assets/ntop-plugin-menu.png" alt="the NetFlow Device configuration is located under Plugins/NetFlow/Configure" /></p>

<p>the NetFlow Device configuration is located under Plugins/NetFlow/Configure.</p>

<p>The first three attributes were all i had to change:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/ntop-netflow-configuration.png" alt="the NetFlow Device configuration form" /></p>

<p><em>NetFlow Device</em> is a name for the device, i used the routers hostname.<br />
<em>Local Collector UDP Port</em> the port we want ntop to listen on. it has to be the same as setup for the rflow probe.<br />
<em>Virtual NetFlow Interface Network Address</em> ip and netmask of the box hosting the rflow probe.  </p>

<p>The last step is switching the nic ntop collects data on to the netflow device.It should be selectable in the admin menu:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/ntop-switch-nic.png" alt="the NetFlow Device configuration form" /></p>

<p>And its done! Data is streaming in and the statistics are filling up.</p>
